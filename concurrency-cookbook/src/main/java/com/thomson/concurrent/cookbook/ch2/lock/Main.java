/**
 * <h2>Synchronizing a block of code with a Lock</h2>
 *
 * <p>When we want to implement a critical section using locks and guarantee that only one execution thread runs a
 * block of code, we have to create a {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock} object. At the beginning of the
 * critical section, we have to get the control of the lock using the {@link Lock#lock()} method. At the end of the
 * critical section, we have to use the {@link Lock#unlock()} method to free the control of the lock and allow the
 * other threads to run this critical section.</p>
