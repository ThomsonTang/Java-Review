/**
 * <h1>The Main Test Class</h1>
 *
 * <h2>How it works...</h2>
 * <p>When you use the {@code synchronized} keyword to protect a block of code, you use an object as
 * a parameter. JVM guarantees that only one thread can have access to <strong>all the blocks of code protected
 * with that object</strong>(note that we always talk about objects, not about classes.).</p>
 *
 * <p>In this example, we have an object that controls access to the {@code vacanciesCinema1} attribute,
 * so only one thread can modify this attribute each time, and another object controls access to the
 * {@code vacanciesCinema2} attribute, so only one thread can modify this attribute each time. But
 * there may be two threads running simultaneously, one modifying the {@code vacanciesCinema1} attribute
 * and the other one modifying the {@code vacanciesCinema2} attribute.</p>
